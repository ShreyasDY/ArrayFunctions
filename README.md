# ArrayFunctions
Write a python program to insert, remove, append item using index from array. Also perform an operation to check whether the array contains any duplicate elements

This program creates an empty list called arr, and then uses the insert() method to insert an item at index 0, the pop() method to remove an item at index 0, and the append() method to add an item to the end of the list.

It also defines a function check_duplicates(arr) that takes an array as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the array contains any duplicate elements or not. It does this by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set of the array elements.

The program then adds some duplicate elements to the array and checks for duplicate elements using the check_duplicates(arr) function.
